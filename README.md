# CS380-Final-Project

The capstone project for CS380 Drawing On The Web

## Project Outline

One of the things that has helped me throughout my time in quarantine, is nostalgia for the past. Whether it be hanging out with real-life friends on the online game Club Penguin or passing the time by delving deep into Wikipedia to learn probably too much about a particular thing from my past, nostalgia has been very helpful to my mental stability. For this project, I want to explore my nostalgia by attempting to clone some of these memories and modifying them in such a way that they represent me in my “quarantine condition.” For example, I would like to possibly make a clone of the old windows maze screensaver and have the “bad guys” that send you back be homework assignments and other responsibilities. This could possibly be a way to symbolize the feeling of being trapped inside alone my apartment while providing some kind of humorous and nostalgic relief. This is the kind of feeling I hope to capture with my artwork. For my navigational interface, I want to try to replicate an older computer desktop gui, one possible idea would be to make some kind of Windows 95 replication with HTML/CSS/JS. My other two drawings will hopefully reflect the feeling of being trapped and lonely but having something to rely on to get through the tough times.
